The question is asking about the endpoint in Express. in express, an endpoint is a specific URL path of a server that clients can "hit" (send requests to) to create/read/update/delete data. For example: /api/data or /api/users/:id.
they do work similar to the way we used them in react but now you get to make them and say what they do.
