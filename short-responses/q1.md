What is the job of a server application?

The server application is responsible for listening for requests and sending requests, this means that server application is the middle groud for what the client asks for and what is in the server.

You got the first part down. The second part is a bit off. There is just some information that is missing. 
The front end and the back end communicate by sending requests and responses. 
Client  <-->  Back end
the back end get broken down to:
server application <--> database
Where the server application processes the request:
client -> request -> listener -> route -> controller -> model -> database -> model -> controller -> client.
Although we have not talked about the databases role in all of the this I wanted to add some clarity to your response.
